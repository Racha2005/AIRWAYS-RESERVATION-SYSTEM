# AIRWAYS-RESERVATION-SYSTEM

INTRODUCTION OF PROJECT
NEED OF PROJECT
As India rapidly moving toward evolution of mechanism, So as to meet the basic necessity we needs to travel from one place to another & only by air we can reach the required place/destination as early as possible.

So aircraft management that is airport management should be developed to meet the 21st century. Therefore, we should design our airport with well equipped technology. It will ease our transportation. By the help of this ‘Airways system’ software we can do all works as fast as we require.

The Proposed system ensures the complete freedom for users, where user at his own system can logon to this website and can book his ticket. Our proposed system allows only registered users to book the tickets, view timings and cancel their tickets.

In this Proposal the entire work is done on online and ticket with id is also provided for passengers as a print document. Here passengers can send their queries and suggestions through a feedback form.

The project “Airline Reservation System” is a dynamic environment to show the coordinated working of the two software’s using the concept of frontend and backend. The frontend tool here is the “Visual Basic” and the backend tool is “MS Access”.

The frontend tool has the responsibility of interacting with the user through the various graphical user interfaces that are represented by the menu forms in this project. The forms are developed independently using Visual Basic and are then combined together to give it the shape of a project. The various forms are interconnected as the menus transfer the control of the execution of the program throughout the execution of the program.

The backend tool has the responsibility of storing the database of records that are entered separately after creating tables in MS Access.

During the execution of the program the Visual Basic calls the database so as to display the flight information that was entered in the Access tables and then the user is provided with a set of options to deal with which include to check about the various flights, to check his ticket and flight status and even cancel an already issued ticket.

The project “Online Air Reservation System ” works simultaneously on two soft wares that form the backbone of the modern computer industry i.e.:-
{A} ACCESS
{B} VISUAL BASIC 6.0

This project works on the concept of frontend and backend tools. Here ACCESS database acts as the backend of the project and VISUAL BASIC forms provide the necessary user interface which is termed as the frontend.

ACCESS database provides all the flights including the name, source, destination, time status etc about the flights available on a particular day. It also contains a table regarding the number of tickets issued and to whom. Cancellation records are also maintained in a separate table that allows the user to cancel an already assigned flight using the ticket number issued to him. Various forms designed to perform different tasks work hand in hand to provide the user with the necessary manus and the required details.

Every form has the option of going back to the previous form so that if a user has by mistake entered some wrong information can go back and edit it.

Forms are loaded and unloaded as the need is specified by the user commands. All the database is accessed using the VISUAL BASIC forms and the user is never confronted to dealing with typical commands of the ACCESS database.

MODULES:
1. Registration module
2. Administrative module
3. Passenger module
   
1. Registration module
In registration module first we ask passenger to give his details.After registering with us the passenger can logon to his/her own account and can view all flight details such as Timings, Prices, Availability of seats and can book the ticket with unique ticket id.Once Passenger registered with us can book any number of tickets.

2. Administrative module
Administrative module is provided for the sake of administrators to manage the site and update the content at regular intervals, The major operations included in this module are:
-->Create and maintain airline schedule, fare and timings of the Flight.
-->View the passenger list.
-->View the available seats in the flights.
-->Cancel the tickets.
-->Updating the flight schedule and timings and fare.

3. Passenger module
This module is meant for passengers, where a user logging into his/her owns account will view this panel. The major operations included in this module were
-->View all airline schedules, timings, fare details and seats availability.
-->Book for the tickets.
-->View and cancelling of the ticket.
-->Send feedback.
Behind these modules, it also includes additional Web Pages like Password recovery console, Tips regarding journey, Traveling news around world and help regarding our site.

Online airline ticketing saves time and money for the customer as well as the airline company thereby making air travel more customer-centric. This project is an attempt to simulate the basic concepts of an airline reservation system. 

Our airline ticket reservation system has the following features:-
Therefore Customers can: 
• Create an account 
• Book tickets in the class (cabins) of their choice 
• Check total number of seats booked in a flight and remaining seats available
• Can make payments with credit card and debit cards only
• Check the flight status that it is confirmed or not
• Cancel booked tickets 
• Book food and beverages in their cabins

Administrators can: 
• Add/Modify flight schedules 
• Viewing the booked ticket statistics 

This system also incorporates a frequent flier miles points system for loyal customers which will provide additional benefits to them.

CONCLUSION:
The Airline reservation system has been a way of minimizing the clerical work, which is almost a routine and consumes the most precious time.

The project entitled “AIRLINE RESERVATION SYSTEM” has been an attempt to help the user to minimize his work load along with minimizing the paper works and saving of time.

The system has been developed in a way to make it very user friendly. It provides an on-line message and an error detection and error messages every time the user needs. Any person having a little bit of window based can run this system without any pain.

Almost all the difficulties of manual reservation have been removed by this system. Ti wind up let me welcome all the suggestions and other improvements, which the system needs so that it covers all the needs if the user in the user way.

Though the system still containing lot of scope of improvement in it. But its overall look and feel gives rough picture of on existing automation system.Thus this software combines the best of both the world i.e. programming language (Visual Basic 6.0) and database (MS Access) providing easy accessibility and security it was developed to benefit the organization and passengers.Finally the system was tested with real data and everything works successfully.

Finally we conclude that this project is made keeping in mind user’s needs we are confident that we have kept almost all things in mind while implementing the same.
